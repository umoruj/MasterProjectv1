                                                      Abstract
Occupancy detection as the name implies, involves the ability to determine building occupancy in real time. In this thesis, 
iBeacons would be the tool of choice in occupancy detection, while turning the occupants mobile devices into sensors. 
This process involves the use of mobile devices, and their integrated sensors, to detect the Bluetooth signals from the iBeacons. 
However, mobile devices are plagued by certain challenges, with respect to software architecture. 
In the issue of mobile devices been battery powered, and the processing and collection of sensor data. 
These challenges, have given rise to various architectural tactics in the area of energy efficiency, and resource control. 
This thesis, aims to provide an empirical investigation, in the feasibility of the structured architectural tactics.

The mobile application was developed using swift 2.2
